Install Locally
- Install Module
- Add module routes to the application that's installing the jobs module
- Start your play application
- In your browser, go to http://localhost:9000/@jobs

You should see all the jobs defined on your application, basically your classes that extend play.jobs.Job.


RESTful API
Using Play!'s RESTEasy's module. All the business logic is encapsulated on service class JobsService which contains 
the annotations necessary to expose the service and bind it as a JSON interface. 
This JSON interface is useful if you need to hook your Play! application into a monitoring solution like Nagios.
